# Structure of Programming Languages - Project

Rust and JavaScript are both highly versatile tools for coding powerful applications, yet each has its own specializations. Both languages vary significantly across programming paradigms, and this project sets out to highlight four of those.

## Installation

In order to execute the code included in this project, one must install both Rust and Node.js

#### [Rust Compiler](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
#### [Node.js Interpreter](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

## Execution
```bash
# JavaScript
node javascript/main.js

# Rust
rustc rust/main.rs && ./main
```

# Programming Paradigms

## Compiled vs. Interpreted

## Static Typing vs. Dynamic Typing

## Pass by Value & Reference vs. Dynamic Passing

## Smart Allocation vs. Garbage Collection
